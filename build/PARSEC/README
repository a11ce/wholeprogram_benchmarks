Currently the rebuild.py file should be used only if you want it to:
1) Download
2) Patch
3) Compile all programs it can
4) Clean

If you want to only do one of those tasks, you can call it with:
1) Download: ./rebuild.py download
2) Patch: ./rebuild.py setup
3) Compile all: ./rebuild.py compile_all
4) Clean: ./rebuild.py clean

If you want it to do all 3, then just call: ./rebuild.sh

If you want to compile benchmarks individually, then call:
 ./scripts/compile.py BENCHMARK
example - ./scripts/compile.py bodytrack
