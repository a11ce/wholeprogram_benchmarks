This condor files and scripts are designed to run the parallelization implemented in NOELLE from the bitcode of the benchamrks generated by the clang front-end.

To run NOELLE, follow the next steps:
1- go to the directory SPEC2017

2- run "make bitcode_copy". 
   This step copy the bitcode coming out of the front-end to the "benchmarks" directories 

3- go to the condor directory (SPEC2017/condor)

4- run make optimize.con
  This step generate a condor file with one job per benchmark. This job will take the baseline bitcode (the one generated in step 2) and replace it with the parallelized bitcode (this is generated by NOELLE).

5- run "make run".
  This submit the jobs that parallelize the bitcodes

6- wait the jobs to end

7- go to the condor directory (SPEC2017/condor)

8- run "make clean ; make binary.con ; make run"
  This step generates the parallel binaries from the parallelized bitcodes

9- wait the jobs to end

10-
