This simple tool does this following:
1) Extracts bitcode from an executable
2) Applies preset compiler (compiler + applier = complier) passes to the bitcode
3) Links in any preset files
4) Compiles bitcode back to an executable

In order to build the 'preset' passes and files the following command could be run:

complier -addFile /path/to/the/file.bc (This will eventually become an argument to llvm-link)
complier -addPass /path/to/the/pass.so invokeName (This will eventually become the arguments to noelle-load)


For instrumenting an executable for CARAT, this would look like:

complier -addFile /path/to/carat.bc
complier -addPass /path/to/carat.so CARAT 

complier -apply executable
