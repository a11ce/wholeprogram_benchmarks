STEP 1)
	Install and build SPEC2017 benchmarks with:
		"./rebuild.sh"
	The script 'rebuild.sh' will do the following:   
		1)Installs a fresh copy of SPEC2017 fetched from /project/benchmarks/SPEC2017.tar.gz
		2)Builds all pure C/C++ speed benchmarks except 'gcc_s' with gclang/gclang++.

STEP 2)
    Setup run directories and extract bitcodes with:
        "./setupRun.sh [workload]" where workload = [test, train, refspeed]

    The script 'setupRun.sh' will do the following:
        1)Setup run directories for specified workload of all benchmarks at 'BenchmarksBitcodes/build/SPEC2017/benchmarks/'
        2)Extract single bitcode files for all built benchmarks at respective run directories. 
		3)Creates run scripts run_workload.sh for each benchmark where workload = [test, train, refspeed]
		4)Copies over all single bitcode files to '/BenchmarksBitcodes/bitcodes/LLVM9.0/SPEC2017'
        
STEP 3) 
    Generate binaries of benchmarks from bitcode files and run them with:
        "./genBinaryfromBitcode.sh [workload] run" where workload = [test, train, refspeed].
    The generated binaries are executed with specified workload ONLY IF "run" is specified as second argument to this script.
    NOTE: This script is provided as a framework to add in calls to your optimization passes before generating binaries and executing them with specified workload.
