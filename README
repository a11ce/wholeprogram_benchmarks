Welcome to the Benchmarks' Bitcodes Repository

This repo is intended to help produce single bitcode files of various benchmarks from many suites.

Inside the bitcodes directory will be the single file bitcodes for different versions of LLVM

Inside the build directory will be scripts needed to generate new bitcode files from the sources.

To install gllvm (a tool that wraps around llvm to build a single bitcode file), please run setup.sh
