REQUIREMENTS: gclang (https://github.com/SRI-CSL/gllvm)

STEP 1) Setup the repository
	Run "make" or "make SPECTAR=YOUR_SPEC_TAR_FILE"

	This will do the following:   
		- Installs a fresh copy of SPEC2017 fetched from /project/benchmarks/SPEC2017.tar.gz (or from what you have specified)
    - Fixed permissions to files in SPEC

STEP 2) Generate the single bitcode file for every benchmark
  Run 
  - "make compile_speed" for speed benchmarks or
  - "make compile_rate" for rate benchmarks

  This will 
	  - Builds all pure C/C++ speed benchmarks except 'gcc_s' with gclang/gclang++.

STEP 3) Save the single bitcode files 
    Run "make bitcode" to setup run directories and extract bitcodes.
    To change input, run "make bitcode INPUT=train"

    This will do the following:
    1)Setup run directories for specified workload of all benchmarks at 'BenchmarksBitcodes/build/SPEC2017/benchmarks/'
    2)Extract single bitcode files for all built benchmarks at respective run directories. 
		3)Creates run scripts run_workload.sh for each benchmark where workload = [test, train, refspeed]
		4)Copies over all single bitcode files to '/BenchmarksBitcodes/bitcodes/LLVM9.0/SPEC2017'
        
STEP 4) Generate the binary from the single bitcode file
    Run the following script to generate binaries of benchmarks from bitcode files
        "./scripts/genBinaryfromBitcode.sh [workload] -run" where workload = [test, train, refspeed].
    The generated binaries are executed with specified workload ONLY IF "-run" is specified as second argument to this script.
    NOTE: This script is provided as a framework to add in calls to your optimization passes before generating binaries and executing them with specified workload.
