Welcome to the Whole-Benchmark bitcode repository

This repo is intended to help produce single bitcode files of various benchmarks from many suites.

Inside the bitcodes directory will be the single file bitcodes for different versions of LLVM

Inside the build directory will be scripts needed to generate new bitcode files from the sources.

To install gllvm (a tool that wraps around llvm to build a single bitcode file), please run "make"

To run benchmarks of the suite X from the Zythos cluster:
  Clone the git repo: git clone /project/benchmarks/repositories/BenchmarksBitcodes

  Enable Go: source /project/go/go_1.13.7/enable

  Compile the framework: from the root directory, run make

  Generate the baseline bitcode files: 
    cd build/X ; make

  To run NOELLE, follow the steps you can find in build/X/condor/doc/README

  If you want to customize the noelle options, modify build/X/makefiles/Makefile

  The outputs of a benchmark (e.g., lbm_s) can be found in build/X/benchmarks/BENCHMARK
